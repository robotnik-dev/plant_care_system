- [ ] Use Rust's strong typing to model thresholds and conditions
- [ ] Learn about iterators and functional programming patterns
- [ ] Write tests for analysis logic

> Mini-Milestone: A program that stores readings in a database and provides analysis on when to water plants.
## Phase 3: Control System (3-4 days)
### Component 5: Actuator Control

- [ ] Interface with a water pump or valve using GPIO
- [ ] Implement safety checks to prevent overwatering
- [ ] Create an abstraction layer for different actuator types

- [ ] Add manual override capabilities

### Component 6: Scheduling System

- [ ] Implement a task scheduler for regular sensor checks
- [ ] Create a configurable watering schedule
- [ ] Use Rust's concurrency features (tokio or async-std)
- [ ] Add support for different scheduling strategies
- [ ] Learn about futures and async/await

> Mini-Milestone: A functional system that monitors soil moisture and waters plants automatically according to a schedule.
## Phase 4: Web API (4-5 days)
### Component 7: HTTP Server

- [ ] Set up a web server using Actix-web or Rocket
- [ ] Create RESTful endpoints for sensor data
- [ ] Implement authentication for API access

## Phase 6: Notifications and Advanced Features (4-5 days)
### Component 11: Notification System

- [ ] Implement email or SMS notifications
- [ ] Create configurable alert thresholds
- [ ] Add support for different notification channels
- [ ] Learn about external API integration
- [ ] Implement rate limiting and batching

### Component 12: Multi-Plant Support

- [ ] Extend the system to support multiple plants/sensors
- [ ] Implement zones or groups of plants
- [ ] Add plant-specific watering rules
- [ ] Create a plant database with care information
- [ ] Learn about database relationships and complex queries
